My First repository for gist 604B
Hi class, my name is Celso pronounced with a soft C like Cell - So. I'm excited to get started with the course and learning the many different open source GIS programs and utilities out there. I'm hoping to learn and gain knowledge on the many different free GIS resources available. One thing that I have learned about Open Source GIS is that it is heavily reliant on the community that uses it for improvements and bug fixes. I enjoy doing many different things, Covid curbed a couple of those things but am hopeful to pick them up once the pandemic is over. I was playing soccer with the Tucson Adult Soccer League (Go Kangaroos!) and eating out at restaurants. Other hobbies I've been able to retain during the pandemic have been running and hiking. My favorite running area is running around Star Pass and my favorite hiking trail is Kings Canyon Trail up to Wasson Peak at Saguaro National Park. Excited to meet the rest of my classmates.
